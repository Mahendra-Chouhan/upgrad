    "txt = \"\"\"Coronavirus Vaccine Registration, Coronavirus Omicron Variant Cases in India Live: Gujarat’s health department has confirmed one more case of Omicron variant which takes up India’s total tally of Omicron cases to three. According to news agency PTI, the infected man is 72-year-old man and had returned to Jamnagar city of Gujarat from Zimbabwe. The Gujarat health department had on Friday informed that the man’s samples were sent for laboratory testing to identify whether he was infected with the new mutant Omicron or not. A South Africa returnee was also booked for violating home quarantine protocol, Chandigarh Health Secretary Yashpal Garg told news agency ANI on Saturday. The woman in question had returned on December 1. Although her RT-PCR report came out to be negative, she still broke home quarantine on December 2 and checked into a hotel. Keeping in view the possibility of travelers breaking protocols and checking into hotels, the local administration has directed the hotels to ask for 15-day travel history of international travelers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two cases of Omicron variant were reported from Karnataka on Thursday after which a wave of panic, fear and concern was felt across states. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Thursday issued a list of frequently asked questions about the Omicron variant. The Centre had earlier also informed that given Omicron’s characteristics, it is likely to spread to more countries, including India, but given the high exposure to delta variant and high-paced vaccination, the severity of the disease is expected to be low.\n",
